# Segment Anything Model (SAM) Project Readme

## Overview

This project utilizes Meta AI's Segment Anything Model (SAM) to perform image segmentation. SAM is a powerful tool that can identify and segment objects within images with minimal input. This project demonstrates how to load a pre-trained SAM model and apply it to segment custom images, highlighting the model's capabilities and potential use cases.

## Key Features

*   **Automatic Image Segmentation:** Leverages SAM's automatic mask generation to identify and segment objects within images.
*   **Customizable Parameters:** Allows users to adjust parameters such as IOU threshold and stability score to fine-tune segmentation results.
*   **Versatile Image Support:** Works with various image types and can be adapted for different segmentation tasks.
*   **Annotation Assistance:** Can be used as a tool to assist in image annotation by providing initial segmentation masks.

## Installation

1.  **Create a Conda Environment:**
    ```
    conda create -n sam_env python=3.9
    conda activate sam_env
    ```
2.  **Install PyTorch and TorchVision:**

    *   First, check your CUDA version (if using GPU):
        ```
        nvcc --version
        ```
    *   Then, install the appropriate PyTorch and TorchVision versions based on your CUDA version. For CUDA 11.0, use:
        ```
        pip install torch==1.7.1 torchvision==0.8.2
        ```
3.  **Install OpenCV and Matplotlib (if not already installed):**
    ```
    pip install opencv-python matplotlib
    ```
4.  **Install Segment Anything Model:**

    *   Download the SAM repository as a zip file from the [official GitHub page](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything).
    *   Unpack the zip file.
    *   Navigate to the unpacked directory in your terminal.
    *   Install SAM locally:
        ```
        pip install -e .
        ```
5.  **Download the Pre-trained Model:**

    *   Download the `sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth` model (or another model of your choice) from the [official SAM GitHub page](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything).
    *   Place the downloaded model in a designated directory within your project.

## Adjusting Parameters

The `pred_iou_thresh` and `stability_score_thresh` parameters in the `SamAutomaticMaskGenerator` function can significantly impact the segmentation results.

*   **`pred_iou_thresh`:**  The lower the threshold, the more objects will be detected.  However, this may also lead to the inclusion of background noise or inaccurate segmentations. Increasing the threshold can reduce noise but may also cause the model to miss some objects.
*   **`stability_score_thresh`:**  This parameter controls the post-processing filtering of segmented objects.  Adjusting this value can help to remove less stable or less reliable segmentations.

Experiment with these values to achieve the best results for your specific images.

## Potential Use Cases

*   **Image Annotation:**  Quickly generate initial masks for objects in images, which can then be refined manually.
*   **Object Detection:**  Identify and locate objects of interest within images.
*   **Image Editing:**  Isolate specific objects for further manipulation or modification.
*   **Scientific Research:**  Segment cells, tissues, or other structures in microscopy images.
*   **Remote Sensing:** Segment houses, buildings, and other geographical features in satellite imagery.
